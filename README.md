# Satify tool:


This tool applies constraint satisfaction techniques to compute the formal semantics of a Reo network.

It uses REDUCE Algebra system (https://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/) for solving the constraints and GraphViz (https://www.graphviz.org/) to generate the result automata. The image below is an example of its output.

To make it easier to use, the tool will be dockerized in near future.


Example:

More examples are being added to ![](![FIFO1](src/test/resources/output) such as a FIFO channel (Unmerged results)
